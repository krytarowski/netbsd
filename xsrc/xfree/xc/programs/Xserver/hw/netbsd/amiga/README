This is the amiga Xserver source, based on Xamiga24, Xcl, Xdaniver, xfree86 and
my (Michael) own work.

Since not all of you have enough memory to support all possible devices, the
supported hardware can be steered with the following #defines (change this in
NetBSD.cf.):

XamigaCCmono           - Old Amiga Mono support from XamigaMono
XamigaCCcolor          - Amiga CustomChips Color support (ECS/AGA), former Xdaniver
XamigaGfxCardSupport   - Support for Gfx Board in general (Chunky Framebuffer)
XamigaRetinaZ3Support  - Support for the GFX accelerator of the RetinaZ3 Graphics board
XamigaCl5426Server     - Support for Cirrus 5426 based Gfx Boards
                         (Picollo, Picollo SD64, Spectrum, PicassoII)
XamigaCV64Support      - Support for the GFX accelerator of the CV64 Graphics board

XamigaGfxCardSupport will be enabled and needed if you set the define of
XamigaRetinaZ3Support, XamigaCl5426Server or XamigaCV64Support to YES.
It is not possible and there is no need to use XamigaCCmono if you enable
XamigaCCcolor.
